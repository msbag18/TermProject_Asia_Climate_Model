# Import all required libraries for model
This assignment was done with data in the format of NetCDF as it is the data format commonly used in Atmospheric Science and Oceanography.  

## Sourcing data 
This is done through the use of Climate Data Store Application Program Interface

## Analysis
Data was analysed using the following generic python libraries:

### 1. Numpy
This is used to deal with large arrays of numerical data - in this case four dimensional latitude/longitude/altitude/time data arrays.

### 2. netCDF
Commonly used to store various variables of many dimensions in Atmospheric Science and Oceanography. The default reading and writing netCDF file is netCDF4 as it has the capability to read and write text files including csv (which are built into numpy)

### 3. sciPy 
Mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy.
Used to add significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data.

## Visualisation 

### 1. Matplotlib
Used to plot library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

### 2. Basemap 
Extension of matplotlib which reate data visualizations, and adds the geographical projections and some datasets to be able to plot coast lines, countries, and so on directly from the library.

## Code
```Python
For sourcing data
import cdsapi
import statsmodels.api as sm

For analysis
from netCDF4 import Dataset as netcdf
from netCDF4 import netcdftime
from netcdftime import utime
from scipy import signal
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

For Visualisation
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap, shiftgrid, interp, addcyclic, cm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdateschan
from matplotlib.dates import MonthLocator, WeekdayLocator, DateFormatter
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
from matplotlib.pylab import rcParams
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

For overall background
from pylab import 
import os
import zipfile
import warnings
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
warnings.simplefilter('ignore')
import warnings
import pandas as pd
import datetime 

```
